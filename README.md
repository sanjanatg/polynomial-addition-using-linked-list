### Header and Definitions

- **Include Libraries**:
  - `#include <stdio.h>`: Standard input and output library.
  - `#include <stdlib.h>`: Standard library for memory allocation and process control.

- **Macro for Dynamic Memory Allocation**:
  - `#define MALLOC(p, n, type)`: Macro to simplify memory allocation with error checking.

### Struct Definitions

- **Node Structure**:
  - `typedef struct Node`: Defines a node in the linked list.
  - `int coeff;`: Coefficient of the polynomial term.
  - `int expo;`: Exponent of the polynomial term.
  - `struct Node* next;`: Pointer to the next node in the list.

- **Polynomial Structure**:
  - `typedef struct`: Defines a polynomial.
  - `Node* head;`: Pointer to the head node of the polynomial's linked list.

### Insert Term Function

- **Function Declaration**:
  - `void insertTerm(Polynomial* poly, int coeff, int expo)`: Function to insert a term into the polynomial.

- **Memory Allocation**:
  - `MALLOC(newNode, 1, Node);`: Allocate memory for a new node with error checking.

- **Node Initialization**:
  - Initialize `newNode` with the given coefficient and exponent, and set `next` to `NULL`.

- **Insert as First Element**:
  - If the list is empty (`poly->head == NULL`), set `head` to `newNode`.

- **Insert in Order**:
  - Traverse the list to find the correct position for the new node, maintaining descending order by exponents.

- **Combine Like Terms**:
  - If a node with the same exponent is found, add the coefficients together to avoid multiple nodes for the same exponent value and keep the polynomial clean.

- **Insert Node**:
  - If no node with the same exponent is found, insert `newNode` at the correct position in the list. Link the previous node to `newNode` if it exists, or set `head` to `newNode` if it's the first element.

### Add Polynomials Function

- **Function Declaration**:
  - `Polynomial addPolynomials(Polynomial* polys, int n)`: Function to add multiple polynomials.

- **Initialize Result Polynomial**:
  - `Polynomial result; result.head = NULL;`: Create an empty result polynomial.

- **Loop Through Polynomials**:
  - For each polynomial in the input array, traverse its linked list and insert each term into the result polynomial using `insertTerm`.

### Display Polynomial Function

- **Function Declaration**:
  - `void displayPolynomial(Polynomial* poly)`: Function to display the polynomial.

- **Traverse and Print**:
  - Traverse the linked list and print each term in the polynomial. If the term is not the head and the coefficient is positive, print a `+` sign.

### Main Function

- **Input Number of Polynomials**:
  - `printf("Enter the number of polynomials: "); scanf("%d", &num);`: Get the number of polynomials from the user.

- **Initialize Polynomials**:
  - Create an array of `Polynomial` structs and initialize each polynomial's head to `NULL`.

- **Input Polynomial Terms**:
  - For each polynomial, get the number of terms, and for each term, get the coefficient and exponent, then insert the term into the polynomial using `insertTerm`.

- **Add Polynomials**:
  - `Polynomial result = addPolynomials(polys, num);`: Add all the polynomials together using the `addPolynomials` function.

- **Display Result**:
  - `displayPolynomial(&result);`: Display the resulting polynomial.

### End of Program

- **Return 0**:
  - Indicate successful program termination.
